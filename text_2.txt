Hydrothermal vents literally grow from cracks in volcanic regions of the ocean floor.  Minerals, as well as methane and sulfide gas, spew from the cracks and mix with the near-freezing water to create this black "smoke." This smoke becomes energy for microorganisms that live through chemosynthesis - transforming minerals into energy (instead of transforming light, like plants do on the earthâ€™s surface).
