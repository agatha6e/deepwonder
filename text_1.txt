Here you see Yeti crabs and a Rimicaris Hybisae shrimp â€“ thriving together at pressures that would smash your human body to nothingness. Bacteria grow on the backs of these creatures, fed by minerals from the vents; later the bacteria becomes food for the crabs and shrimp! Hydrothermal vents can be quite close to one another; these creatures ride deep sea currents to move from vent to vent.
