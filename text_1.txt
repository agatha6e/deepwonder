Here you see Yeti Crabs and a Rimicaris Hybisae Shrimp - thriving together in this seemingly inhospitable environment  at pressures that would smash your body to nothingness if you werenâ€™t inside a specially designed tiny 2-person submarine. Both creatures eat bacteria that grow on their bodies, while the bacteria feed on the minerals in the vents. Hydrothermal vents can be quite close to one another -  a few meters or kilometers -  and these creatures can move from vent to vent with the help of deep sea currents.
