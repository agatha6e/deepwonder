Here you see yeti crabs and a Rimicaris hybisae shrimp â€“ thriving together at pressures that would smash your human body to nothingness. Bacteria grow on the backs of these creatures, fed by minerals from the vents; later the bacteria become food for the crabs and shrimp! Hydrothermal vents can be quite close to one another; these creatures ride deep sea currents to move from vent to vent.
