This spine once supported the fat, muscle, lungs and organs of a 100,000 pound fin whale as it broke the surface of the ocean to breathe. Take a breath and feel your own spine as air moves into your lungs and capillaries distribute oxygen to your bloodstream. Inside/outside, ocean/land, whale/human. How can you nurture these connecting cycles of life?
