You are on the ocean floor standing before the Faulty Towers hydrothermal vent about a mile below sea level. Created from a crack in a volcanic region of the ocean floor, this vent is 30’ tall and spews superheated water mixed with methane, sulfide gas and minerals. It is freezing and pitch black down here, except near the vent where temperatures can reach 400° celsius.
