You are on the ocean floor, about a mile deep, 500 miles off shore of Seattle, standing in front of the Faulty Towers Hydrothermal vent, created from a crack in the ocean floor. It reaches up to 30â€™ high and spews superheated water mixed with methane, sulfide gas and minerals. It is pitch black down here, and extremely cold, except near this vent, where temps can reach over 400 degrees celsius.
