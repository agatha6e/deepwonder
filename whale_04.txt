When a whale dies, it is buried in its own home, the ocean. Thereâ€™s not a lot of food down here, and the whale fall becomes a banquet table with food lasting dozens of years. It brings together octopi, eels, fish and other sea creatures, and becomes a home for worms like the Oesedax, which feed on fat and protein trapped inside the whale bones, consuming it with the help of symbiotic bacteria living in their bodies.
