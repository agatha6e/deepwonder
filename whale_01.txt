You are 1,000 feet below the surface of the sea, off the coast of San Diego, looking at a “whale fall”-- a whale that has died and sunk to the ocean floor. This is the skeleton of a Fin Whale, a whale fall nicknamed “Rosebud” by ocean scientists, a tribute to  the thousands of  little red tubeworm plumes that can grow on a single whale. Rosebud was a whale that was struck and killed by a ship, and scientists dragged it to a place where it could be studied over time.
