These towers are called chimneys or “smokers” – they’re created when the smoke spewing from the vent cools and solidifies, and are made of iron oxide and pyrite (“fools gold”). Both iron and sulfur live in your body right now and are needed to keep you alive. The communities around these chimneys are an intimate part of complex systems of life – and we participate in those systems, often without being aware of it.
