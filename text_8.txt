When a whale dies, it is buried in its own home. On the ocean floor, it becomes a banquet table with food lasting dozens of years, bringing together octopi, eels, fish and more. Worms like these Osedax feed on fat trapped inside whale bones with the help of symbiotic bacteria living in their worm-bodies.
