When a whale dies, it is buried in its own home. On the ocean floor, it becomes a banquet table with food lasting dozens of years, bringing together octopi, eels, fish and more. The red “fuzzies” you can see here are actually Osedax worms, which bore into whale bones for the fat trapped inside – which they consume with the the help of symbiotic bacteria living in their worm-bodies.
