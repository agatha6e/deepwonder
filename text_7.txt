Whales are ocean “mixers”-- rising to the surface to breathe, dropping down to feed, covering vast miles distance, and carrying and dropping off micro-organisms along the way. When a whale dies it connects the very top and very bottom of the ocean. After living in the upper ocean during their lifetime, they fall to the bottom and become a multi-year feast for creatures who continue the cycle of ocean systems.
