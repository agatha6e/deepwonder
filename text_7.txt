Whales are ocean “mixers”– rising to the surface to breathe, dropping down to feed, carrying and dropping off micro-organisms along the way. After living in the upper ocean during their lifetime, they fall to the bottom and become a multi-year feast for creatures who continue the cycle of ocean systems: a “whale fall.”
